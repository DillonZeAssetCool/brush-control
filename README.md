# Brush Cleaning Machine – User Guide

## Overview

This README provides instructions for safely operating the Brush Cleaning Machine, including system startup, brush depth calibration, cleaning cycle configuration, sample unloading, and emergency procedures.

## 1. Safety Precautions

Before operating the machine, ensure the following safety requirements are met:

- **Clear the Area:** Ensure the machine's movement path is completely free of obstacles.
- **Emergency Access:** Keep the main power switch easily accessible so the machine can be powered off quickly if necessary.
- **Check Cables:** Verify that no cables are tangled, loose, or caught on moving parts.

> **WARNING:** Do not operate the machine if its movement path is obstructed or if cables interfere with moving components.

---

## 2. System Startup Process

When the application starts, all control buttons are temporarily disabled while the system initializes.

### Automatic Initialization Sequence

1. **Homing:** The machine automatically moves to its standard starting (home) position.
2. **Load Cell Initialization:** The load cell sensor powers on and resets its reading to zero (tares).
3. **System Ready:** Once both operations are complete, the control buttons unlock and become interactive.

> **Note:** Wait until the initialization sequence finishes before attempting to operate the machine.

## 3. Brush Depth Calibration

By default, the brush is safely lifted away from the plate surface.

Before starting a cleaning cycle, calibrate the brush height using the following procedure.

### Calibration Steps

**Step 1: Mount a Clean Plate**

- Place a clean plate onto the fixture.
- Pull the handle to clamp the plate securely in position.

**Step 2: Select Calibration Area**

Select one of the calibration buttons located at the top of the application:

- `CAL AREA 1`
- `CAL AREA 2`
- `CAL AREA 3`

The brush will automatically move to the selected area and pause just above the plate surface.

**Step 3: Adjust Brush Height**

- Use the height control buttons to raise or lower the brush.
- Each adjustment changes the brush height by **1 mm**.

**Step 4: Save or Cancel Calibration**

| Action | Button | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Save calibration | `Save Height -> Standby Mode` | Saves the selected brush height and returns to standby mode |
| Cancel calibration | `Cancel -> Standby Mode` | Cancels the adjustment and returns to standby mode |

**Step 5: Load the Test Sample**

- Remove the clean calibration plate.
- Replace it with the test sample plate.
- Ensure the test sample is securely clamped before proceeding.

## 4. Running a Cleaning Cycle

After calibration, configure the cleaning parameters and start the brushing process.

### Step 1: Set Cleaning Speed

The default brushing speed is **1 m/min**.

To modify the speed:

1. Click the speed input bar.
2. Enter the desired speed between `1` and `10` m/min.
3. Press `Enter` to confirm.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Default speed | 1 m/min |
| Minimum speed | 1 m/min |
| Maximum speed | 10 m/min |

> **Note:** Speed values above 10 m/min will not be accepted by the system.

### Step 2: Set Number of Runs

1. Click the run count input field.
2. Enter the required number of brushing passes.
3. Press `Enter` to confirm.

**Run Count Definition**

- `1 Run` = One brushing pass in a single direction.
- `2 Runs` = One complete back-and-forth brushing cycle.

**Example:** To perform 5 complete back-and-forth cycles, enter `10` runs.

### Step 3: Start Cleaning

1. Verify the configured speed and run count.
2. Ensure the test sample is securely mounted.
3. Click the button corresponding to the target cleaning area.
4. The machine will begin the brushing process.

## 5. Unloading the Test Sample

After the cleaning cycle is complete:

1. Check the **Total Run Count** displayed on the application screen.
2. Click `Ready for Pickup`.
3. Wait for the machine to move the plate clear of the brushing system.
4. Remove the test sample from the fixture.

> **Important:** Do not attempt to remove the sample while the machine is moving.

---

## 6. Emergency Stop Procedure

If an issue occurs during operation, use the emergency stop control.

### Stopping the Machine

1. Locate the `STOP` button next to the `Ready for Pickup` button.
2. Click `STOP` to immediately pause machine operation.
3. Assess the issue and ensure the machine is safe before proceeding.

### Returning to Home Position

Once the issue has been resolved and the machine is safe to operate:

1. Click the `STOP` button again.
2. The machine will return to its home position.
3. Resume testing when the system is ready.

> **WARNING:** The software STOP control pauses machine operation. For an electrical emergency, use the main power switch as appropriate. Do not reach into moving machinery or attempt to clear obstructions until hazardous motion has stopped and the equipment is safely isolated.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### X-Axis Motor Irregular Behavior

**Issue:** The X-axis motor exhibits irregular or unexpected movement.

**Possible Cause:** A loose ribbon cable connection.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Stop machine operation.
2. Safely isolate the machine before inspecting electrical connections.
3. Have an authorized person check the X-axis ribbon cable connection.
4. If the issue persists, contact an engineer for assistance.

> **Note:** Do not continue testing if the X-axis motor behaves unexpectedly.
